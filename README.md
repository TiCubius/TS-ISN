# TERMINALE SCIENTIFIQUE / OPTION ISN
## What is it?
Welcome to the most boring repository ever made.
Basically, this Github repository contains all the scripts that I have had to create for school. It contains either badly written Python or HTML/CSS/JS as it is the languages we are asked to use.

## Why would you put it on your GitHub account then?!
Well, it **is**, despite all I can say, work that I have done.
Either, I'll refactor theses whenever I have spare time, more knowledge and feel like it or it will stay as "this is what I used to do" sort of thing.

*Also, It can be useful whenever I need to work with someone else.*

## Can I use this?
I don't know why you'd want to, but sure.
As long as you credit me *(sort of)* or tell me what you're using it for :)
